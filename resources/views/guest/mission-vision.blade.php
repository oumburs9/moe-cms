            It
            is an instrument of cultivating the individual holistically, including oneâ€™s moral, cognitive, social,
            spiritual, physical, psychological and vocational attributes. It is also understood as a public good based
            on
            indigenous and global knowledge, which serves as a means of social harmony and development. Education is
            perceived by society as an entity that depends on excellence, competitiveness and collaboration. Moreover,
            it is
            recognized as an instrument of expanding the horizons of knowledge and advancing science and technology, to
            transform the country into a respectable member of the world.</p>
